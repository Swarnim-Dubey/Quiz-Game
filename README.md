# Quiz-Game
This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular quiz show "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (KBC). It simulates the full quiz experience with a series of multiple-choice questions and includes iconic lifelines such as:

50:50 – Removes two incorrect options.
Double Dip – Gives the player two chances to answer the same question.
Flip the Question – Allows the player to skip the current question and get a new one.

The game is designed to test general knowledge while providing an interactive and engaging command-line interface. It supports score tracking, input validation, and lifeline logic, all structured using beginner-friendly Python concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals.
